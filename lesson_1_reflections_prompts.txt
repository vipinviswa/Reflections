How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    nice

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can modify the source at eany time without worrying it is going to break and can not be recoverable if a bug is introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: Each commit will be precise and upto the mark
    cons: at a high level, if something happen to the working directory, there is no way to recover it if there is no back up is available.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is nore programming oriented. For implementing a particular logic, you need to modify multiple files at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give you the history up to the current version. git diff will help you to compare two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    100%

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To create a repository and play with that
