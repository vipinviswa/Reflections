1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git will put its infrastruture elements to the repository. Only using this infrastructure elements, Git can move forward and assist us to do the commits and the other operations.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory and repository are the superset with all the files but staging area contains only the selected files to make a commit based on the logical implementation that you are going to commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use git add to selectively add the files to the staging area. After that, i can use git diff --staged to compare the items in the staging area to the one in repository. During this comparison, i can ensure that everything is based on the logical unit that i am intended to check-in.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If i need to try soemthing experimenting or to do some code refactoring, etc. Branches will create a separate area to work on instead of disturbing the main branch.
